.SH NAME
runc \- Open Container Project runtime
.SH DESCRIPTION
runc is a command line client for running applications packaged according to the Open Container Format (OCF) and is
a compliant implementation of the Open Container Project specification.
.PP
runc integrates well with existing process supervisors to provide a production container runtime environment for
applications. It can be used with your existing process monitoring tools and the container will be spawned as a direct
child of the process supervisor.
.PP
After creating a spec for your root filesystem with runc, you can execute a simple container in your shell by running:
.IP
cd \fI\,/mycontainer\/\fP
